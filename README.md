# neXenio Frontend Challenge

## Challenge description

Your task is to gather and arrange additional information, given the content of a digital whiteboard.

From one of our neXboards, we've extracted the sticky notes as a JSON file that you find as `data.json`.

Parse the data and use it to query at least one social media API of your choice. Examples are:

- [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)
- [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/#GET_search)
- [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation)
- [Wikipedia API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wikipedia-js)

Then, the challenge is to layout and arrange the responses you get on a single page in a creative or beneficial way.

## Instructions
- Don't spend more than 3 hours on this challenge. We're not looking for production-readiness.
- Use pure Javascript for the logic – no underscore / lodash libraries
- Use pure CSS for the styling of the UI – no external libraries
- Using React would be great, since at the moment, it's likely you will work with React at neXenio, But we're open for your own technical choices.
- Unit tests and tooling like bundlers / linting are a plus.
- Make sure you make it easy for us to start and check your solution locally.

## What we're looking for
- Code quality
- Correctness
- Technical choices
